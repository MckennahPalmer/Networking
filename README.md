# Overview

I am trying to become the best software engineer that I can be, and I can't do that by skipping ahead or going to fast. 
I trying to become the best by mastering many different aspects of programming! Like gaining a stronger understanding
of networking, specifically the peer to peer model!

I built a program that should use peer to peer networking when it runs. I set up the nodes and their class in a
rudimentary network in MyOwnPeer2PeerNode.py, then I wrote the script in a separate file. When the script is going, then
it should open the node connections between the 3 nodes. The first node send "Marco" for a bit before it stops, and then the 
other two send "Polo" right back before the program ends.

This was suppose the help me get a feel for Peer to Peer networking, and maybe help me learn to use python better.

# Network Communication

I am using peer to peer architecture. Which in the most simple terms is a device connecting to another device instantly 
without connecting to a large computer server first.

I believe I am using TCP and I should be using whatever port is assigned the TCP server at the current IP address.

The format of the messages should be a string.

# Development Environment

I used android studios once again, but while I could write my program there, I couldn't seem to run it in android studios.

I used Python3 to write the program, TCP sockets and servers, and the standard networking libraries.

# Future Work

* Learn more Python and become proficient
* Make a peer to peer network that can connect to multiple nodes at once
* Figure out validation tests for nodes.
